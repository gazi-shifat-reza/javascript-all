/*
What is synchronous programming:
Synchronous programming is basically you can only execute one thing at a time.
If any statement or a line takes one hour to execute thats mean all the other statements have to wait one hour. All the other line have to wait until that line to execute.

What is Asynchronous programming:
Asynchronous means that you can execute multiple things at a time and you don' have to finish executing the current thing in order to move on to next one.
