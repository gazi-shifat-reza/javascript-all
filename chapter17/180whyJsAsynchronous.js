/*

Javascript is basically a synchronous language but we can make Javascript to act as a asynchronous language. For that 4 things work behind the scene.

1. Call stack: This is stack like data structure as LIFO. It handles all the function calls. Which call come after which call.

2. Web API: This is a provider which is provide us some features to make Javascript asynchronous.

3. Callback Queue: This is queue like data structure as FIFO.  It handles all the function calls. Which call come after which call.

4. Event loop: It decides which Callback needs to execute and sends to call stack.
